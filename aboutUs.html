        <h1>About Mokesell</h1>
        <p>
            Founded in 1995 in Singapore, Mokesell began as a trusted name in shoe cleaning solutions, helping sneaker enthusiasts keep their kicks fresh. Over the years, the company evolved to meet the changing needs of the market, transforming into a dynamic online marketplace where users can buy and sell shoes, fashion, and lifestyle products—similar to Carousell.
            
            The brand’s playful and energetic identity is rooted in its founders, who were born in the Year of the Monkey. This connection is reflected in Mokesell’s signature banana logo, symbolizing agility, creativity, and a fun shopping experience.
            
            Mokesell is built on a commitment to authenticity, ease of use, and community engagement. Whether you're a sneakerhead hunting for rare finds or a casual seller looking to declutter, the platform provides a secure and user-friendly space for transactions. With a blend of heritage and innovation, Mokesell continues to redefine online shopping, making it more personal, reliable, and enjoyable.</p>
